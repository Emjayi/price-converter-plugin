# Price Converter Plugin - 503 Error Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve the 503 "Service Unavailable" error when opening products in WordPress.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **External API failures** - Calls to Navasan API could hang or fail
2. **Infinite loops** - Price filter hooks could create recursive calls
3. **Missing error handling** - Exceptions and errors weren't properly caught
4. **Resource exhaustion** - API calls and processing could consume excessive resources
5. **Stuck transients** - Processing flags could get stuck, blocking operations

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Safe Price Filter Methods**
- Added `filter_product_price_safe()` and `filter_price_html_safe()` methods
- Implemented infinite loop prevention using static tracking arrays
- Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- All price filters now use safe methods instead of direct ones

### 2. **Enhanced API Error Handling**
- Reduced API timeout from 20s to 15s
- Added processing flag to prevent multiple simultaneous API calls
- Implemented proper error logging for all API failures
- Added fallback mechanisms when API calls fail
- Increased cache duration from 2 minutes to 5 minutes

### 3. **Improved Rate Conversion Safety**
- Added validation for all input parameters
- Implemented multiple fallback levels for exchange rates
- Added error handling for JSON parsing and calculations
- Ensured non-negative results in tax calculations

### 4. **Fallback Mode System**
- Added admin setting to completely disable price conversion
- When enabled, shows admin fields but doesn't modify frontend prices
- Provides emergency switch if issues persist

### 5. **Transient Management**
- Added automatic cleanup of stuck processing flags
- Implemented timeout-based cache invalidation
- Added health checks on plugin initialization

### 6. **Plugin Initialization Safety**
- Wrapped plugin loading in try-catch blocks
- Added graceful failure handling with admin notices
- Prevents plugin from loading if critical errors occur

### 7. **Comprehensive Error Logging**
- Added detailed error logging for all critical operations
- Logs include context information for debugging
- Errors are logged but don't crash the system

## Files Modified

### `includes/class-price-converter-woocommerce.php`
- Added safe filter methods
- Enhanced API error handling
- Implemented fallback mode
- Added transient cleanup
- Improved rate conversion safety

### `includes/class-price-converter-admin.php`
- Added fallback mode setting
- Enhanced settings validation
- Added new admin controls

### `price-converter-plugin.php`
- Added plugin initialization error handling
- Enhanced safety checks

### `test-plugin-health.php` (New File)
- Comprehensive plugin health checker
- Tests all critical functionality
- Provides diagnostic information

## How to Use the Fixes

### Immediate Relief
1. **Enable Fallback Mode**: Go to WooCommerce → Price Converter → Set "Fallback Mode" to "Disabled"
2. **This will immediately stop price conversion and should resolve 503 errors**

### Long-term Solution
1. **Run Health Check**: Access `/test-plugin-health.php` to diagnose issues
2. **Check Error Logs**: Look for specific error messages
3. **Monitor Performance**: Use the health checker to verify improvements

### Configuration Options
- **Fallback Mode**: Enable/disable price conversion entirely
- **API Timeout**: Reduced to 15 seconds (from 20)
- **Cache Duration**: Increased to 5 minutes (from 2)
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive logging enabled

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. **Basic Functionality Test**
- Open a product page - should load without 503 errors
- Check if prices are displayed correctly
- Verify admin interface works

### 2. **Health Check**
- Run the health check script
- Review all test results
- Address any remaining issues

### 3. **Performance Test**
- Monitor page load times
- Check server resource usage
- Verify no infinite loops occur

## Emergency Procedures

### If 503 Errors Persist
1. **Enable Fallback Mode** immediately
2. **Check server error logs** for specific messages
3. **Run health check** to identify issues
4. **Contact hosting provider** if server-level issues exist

### If Plugin Won't Load
1. **Check WordPress debug log**
2. **Verify file permissions**
3. **Check for PHP version compatibility**
4. **Review server error logs**

## Prevention Measures

### 1. **Regular Monitoring**
- Run health checks weekly
- Monitor error logs
- Check API connectivity

### 2. **Configuration Best Practices**
- Set reasonable exchange rates
- Use fallback mode during maintenance
- Monitor API key validity

### 3. **Server Requirements**
- Ensure sufficient memory (256MB+ recommended)
- Set reasonable execution time limits (30s+)
- Enable error logging

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **API timeouts**: Check internet connectivity and API status
- **Memory issues**: Increase PHP memory limit
- **Execution timeouts**: Increase max_execution_time
- **Database issues**: Check WordPress database health

### Getting Help
1. Run the health check script
2. Review error logs
3. Check this documentation
4. Contact support with specific error messages

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes address the root causes of 503 errors by:
- Preventing infinite loops and resource exhaustion
- Adding comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- Providing emergency disable options
- Implementing proper resource management
- Adding diagnostic tools for ongoing monitoring

These changes should resolve the 503 errors while maintaining the plugin's functionality. The fallback mode provides an immediate solution if issues persist, and the health checker helps identify and resolve any remaining problems.
